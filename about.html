            I’m Nick Cacace, this is the website I’ve been making on breaks. I went to UCONN for Computer Engineering, and currently live in Connecticut working as a Systems Engineer. I have quite a few interests and I’m always working on some kind of project, so I decided to by my name as a domain and start to better document it here. Some of the things I’m interested in are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Game development (C#, C++, Java)</li>
            <li>Systems Programming (C, MIPS, Verilog, VHDL)</li>
            <li>Woodworking</li>
            <li>3D Printing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is my first hand at making a website and learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so bear with me as I try to translate some of my programming experience to these new mediums.
